                    <li><h3>High‑level project description</h3>
                        This is a frontend web application starter built with Vite, React, TypeScript, 
                        Tailwind CSS, and shadcn‑ui, generated and managed through the Lovable platform.
                         It is designed as a modern, strongly‑typed UI boilerplate that can be extended 
                         into dashboards, SaaS frontends, or internal tools.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Build tool and dev server: Vite provides fast HMR, optimized bundling, and environment‑based builds using the standard dev, build, build:dev, and preview scripts.
</li><li>Frontend framework: React 18 with TypeScript for component‑based UI and type safety.</li><li>Styling: Tailwind CSS + tailwindcss-animate + @tailwindcss/typography for utility‑first styling, animations, and rich text.
</li><li>UI library: shadcn‑ui components powered by Radix UI primitives (@radix-ui/react-*) for accessible dialogs, menus, forms, tabs, tooltips, etc.
</li><li>Form & validation: react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, and zod for typed schemas and client‑side validation.
​</li> <li>State & data fetching: @tanstack/react-query for server‑state management and caching; @supabase/supabase-js is available for backend‑as‑a‑service integration when needed.
​</li> <li>Routing & charts: react-router-dom for client‑side routing and recharts for data visualizations.
</li> <li>TypeScript configs (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json) separate app code, node tooling, and strict type options, while ESLint config enforces consistent code quality.
 </li>
